# Neural Network Operations Performance Analysis

This repository contains implementations and performance benchmarks of basic neural network operations using C/C++, Python, and GPU acceleration techniques. The project explores matrix-vector multiplication, vector addition, FFT, Softmax, and more complex neural network operations like CNN and Scaled Dot Product Attention across multiple platforms and libraries.
